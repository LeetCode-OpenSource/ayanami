An **Effect** is the core primitive of ayanami.

It is a method in ayanami class which takes a stream of `Payloads` and returns a stream of actions. **Payloads in, actions out.**

It has roughly this type signature:

```ts
<Payload>(action$: Observable<Payload>): Observable<Action>;
```

While you'll most commonly produce actions out in response to some `Payload` you received in, that's not actually a requirement! Once you're inside your **Effect**, use any Observable patterns you desire as long as any output from the final, returned stream, is an action.

The actions you emit will be immediately dispatched to their `Module`.

If emmit action which actually associated with an **Effect** itself, it may create an infinite loop:

```typescript
// DO NOT DO THIS
something(payload$: Observable<void>) {
  return payload$.map(() => this.getActions().something())
}
```

## Access **AppState** in **Effect**
In ayanami instances, we could access the `state$` property, which is a `Observable` represent the **latest** state.
We do not provide any way to access state directly in **Effect**, because access state directly rather than the reactive way would cause problems in many scenarios, and many of these problems are hard to debug.
Think about the code snippets below:

```ts
@Module('B')
class ModuleB extends Ayanami<BState> {
  defaultState = {}

  constructor(private readonly httpClient: HttpClient) {
    super()
  }

  @Effect()
  addAndSync(payload$: Observable<number>) {
    return payload$.pipe(
      mergeMap((payload) => {
        const state = this.getState()
        return this.httpClient.get(`/api/something`, {
          body: {
            query: payload
          }
        }).pipe(
          map((response) => {
            if (state.expireIn < Date.now()) { // state here is staled
              return this.getActions().setResponse(response.body)
            } else {
              return this.getActions().setExpired(response.body)
            }
          }),
          catchError(...),
          startWith(this.getActions().setLoading(true)),
          endWith(this.getActions().setLoading(false)),
        )
      })
    )
  }
}
```

If we access state in first `mergeMap` by `getState` directly, and reuse it in the `map` operator then, the state may already stated when we really use it. It could simply fix by `getState` in the `map` operator, but it's truly hard to debug.

So, always access state in `reactive` way is a better practice:

```ts
@Module('B')
class ModuleB extends Ayanami<BState> {
  defaultState = {}

  constructor(private readonly httpClient: HttpClient) {
    super()
  }

  @Effect()
  addAndSync(payload$: Observable<number>) {
    return payload$.pipe(
      mergeMap((payload) => {
        return this.httpClient.get(`/api/something`, {
          body: {
            query: payload
          }
        }).pipe(
          withLatestFrom(this.state$),
          map(([response, state]) => {
            if (state.expireIn < Date.now()) { // always latest state here
              return this.getActions().setResponse(response.body)
            } else {
              return this.getActions().setExpired(response.body)
            }
          }),
          catchError(...),
          startWith(this.getActions().setLoading(true)),
          endWith(this.getActions().setLoading(false)),
        )
      })
    )
  }
}
```
